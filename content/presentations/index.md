My general ethos revolves around sharing what excites me in a given year. I approach presentations as an evolving process: I start by delivering them based on my current understanding, and then I continually refine and improve them as I receive feedback and deepen my knowledge.

After each iteration, I adjust, incorporating new insights and enhancements to make the content more engaging and informative. Most of my presentations are delivered in person; unfortunately, many aren't recorded. However, I aim to make a final recording of each topic once I feel it's fully developed, and I upload it for broader access. This way, even if you miss the live experience, you can still benefit from the final version, representing my most comprehensive understanding of the subject.

My public speaking journey was significantly shaped during my time with Toastmasters International District 74. From 2015 to 2018, I served as Vice President of Education for Johannesburg Toastmasters and as Area Director for L2. This experience allowed me to hone my skills and connect with many wonderful individuals, some of whom remain close friends to this day.
