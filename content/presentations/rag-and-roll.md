17:40 - 18:00 Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation with GraphRAG by Luis de Sousa

GraphRAG, developed by Microsoft Research, takes RAGs to the next level by moving beyond basic semantic search. Instead, it turns text into knowledge graphs and community hierarchies, providing a more nuanced context for generating content. In this session, I'll demonstrate how GraphRAG's unique approach boosts the accuracy and relevance of RAG outputs and how these same principles can be applied to solve various problems.
