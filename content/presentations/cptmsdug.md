RAG + Graph: Better Together for Next-Level GenAI with GraphRAG

Join us for a 45-minute overview of GraphRAG, an innovative approach from Microsoft Research that reshapes the future of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Unlike traditional RAG methods that rely on basic semantic search using plain text snippets, GraphRAG goes further with a structured, hierarchical approach. By transforming raw text into a comprehensive knowledge graph and building a community hierarchy, GraphRAG generates insightful, contextually rich summaries that revolutionise content retrieval and generation. Donâ€™t miss this chance to explore a groundbreaking technique that will elevate your AI-powered content generation to the next level.
