## 👋 Introduction
In this hilarious comedy performance, [Lou Wall](https://www.instagram.com/thelouwall/), a multi-media stand-up comedian, recounts the story of trying to give away a free bed frame on Facebook Marketplace. What should have been a simple exchange turns into a chaotic saga when Eileen misinterprets pickup times, arrives at 5 a.m., steals a neighbour's bed, and sends increasingly bizarre messages with dramatic emoji usage.

After watching this gem from the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, I asked myself:

**What if both these people were neurodivergent?**

What if this whole chaotic exchange was **two people trying to get their needs met** - in the best way they knew how?

Suddenly, the story became more than comedy.

It became a parable of miscommunication, revealing a deeply human aspect of a chaotic world. Where expectations clash, systems fail, and nobody shares the same map.

## 🏗️ The Setup: Lou - Structured & Creative Neurodivergent
Lou Wall transforms a chaotic online interaction into a **PowerPoint-powered pop musical**, revealing both brilliance and the exhaustion of managing overwhelming social chaos.

Her behaviours reflect traits common in autistic or OCD-style cognition:
- ✅ **Plans ahead**: Converts the event into a structured musical narrative
- ✅ **Manages ambiguity**: Clearly states "It's free" and sets boundaries
- ✅ **Assumes systems work logically**: Expects Facebook Marketplace to follow rules
- ✅ **Copes through creation**: Uses humour, sarcasm, and storytelling as forms of emotional regulation - a kind of **autistic masking**

🌀 Under stress, Lou seeks **control through structure** - setting exact pickup times, delegating roles ("Ask for Tim"), and translating chaos into art.

## ⚡ The Twist: Eileen - Emotive, Hyperfocused Neurodivergent
Eileen bursts into the story like a whirlwind of **emotional urgency and literal interpretation**, suggesting traits associated with ADHD, rejection sensitivity, or borderline emotional styles:

- 🕔 **Time blindness**: Arrives at 5 a.m., misinterpreting "See you at 5"
- 🎯 **Hyperfocus**: Fixates on getting the bed, regardless of signals
- 😭 **Emotional dysregulation**: Expresses herself with intense emoji's ("🪓⛏️🔥 🤢🔥," "😡🐬💩")
- 🚪 **Boundary blurring**: Wakes up housemates, returns uninvited, takes a neighbour's bed by mistake

To Eileen, this is all **logically driven by emotional necessity**. The bed represents a **goal, a connection, a victory** - and failure is existential.

## 🪞 The Collision: Different Desires, Different Distress

| Trait                      | **Lou** (Structure-Oriented)        | **Eileen** (Emotion-Oriented)         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Seeks**                 | Order, predictability, logic         | Connection, approval, and closure     |
| **Coping Mechanism**      | Humor, irony, narrative reframing    | Repetition, volume, urgency           |
| **Trigger**               | Plans being ignored                  | Emotional signals being missed        |
| **Processing Style**      | Externalises chaos as comedy         | Remains trapped in emotional feedback |

📌 What we're seeing isn't villainy or madness - it's **two neurodivergent people misunderstanding each other**, speaking different neurocognitive "languages" in a **neurotypical system with no translation layer**.

This perfectly illustrates the **Double Empathy Problem**. The idea is that miscommunication isn’t due to a deficit in one person but a mutual lack of shared context and understanding between people with different neurotypes.

Rather than one being "socially broken", both are **struggling to empathise across neurocognitive differences.**

## 📊 Trait Radar Chart: Lou vs. Eileen
To visualise this divergence in cognitive profiles:

![Radar Chart: Lou vs. Eileen](/pics/neurodivergent-trait-profiles-Lou-vs-Eileen.png)

This chart shows:
- Lou's **preference for order, clarity, and indirect emotion**
- Eileen's **emotive urgency, impulsivity, and literalness**

They're not broken - just **differently calibrated**.

## 🔄 The Tragic Comedy of Neurodivergence
What makes this story so funny - and painfully relatable - is that it could *easily happen to any of us*:
- 😇 Neither person is "wrong" - both are **operating in good faith**
- 📉 Facebook Marketplace, like many platforms, **assumes neurotypical behavior**: vague time, soft expectations, polite emotional distance
- 🎭 Instead, we get a chaotic duet of **raw emotion vs. rigid planning**

## 👊 The Platform Becomes the Punchline

To add the **meta-ironic cherry on top**, the official Facebook account commented on Lou’s [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DIUhTSZKNPr/) of the video:

> “Gives standing ovation”

This moment is **telling and poetic**, the **system that failed to support two neurodivergent users applauds the story of its own failure** - not by improving, but by **engaging performatively.**

It’s like the software clapping for the bug report that became a viral TED Talk.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts: A Neurodivergent Parable
Through a **neurodiversity-affirming lens**, this story is more than just a quirky comedy; it is a **poignant exploration of human experiences.** It's a **parable of miscommunication** where both Lou and Eileen **strive to be understood in their own way.**

> "Two people, each navigating the world with a unique operating system, collide in a system that offers no tech support."

This underscores the **deep human need for recognition and validation.** Lou's public performance can be seen as a defence mechanism, a way to regain control over a bewildering experience. At the same time, Eileen's abrupt block reflects a protective withdrawal in response to perceived betrayal.

In the end, what might seem like a **comedic sketch** is a **deeply human drama** about the **struggle for connection** in a world that often **fails to understand or support neurodivergent modes of being.**

It's **hilarious**.

It’s a bit of a **mystery**.

It's a little **tragic**.

But above all - **it's deeply human**.
