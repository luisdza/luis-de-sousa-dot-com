🎥 *Lou Wall gives the craziest Facebook Marketplace story yet*

🎤 *Melbourne International Comedy Festival*

## 🎭 The Setup: Lou - the Structured & Creative Neurodivergent
Lou Wall transforms a chaotic online interaction into a **PowerPoint-powered pop musical**, revealing both brilliance and burnout. Her behaviours reflect traits common in autistic or OCD-style cognition:
- ✅ **Plans ahead**: Converts the event into a structured musical narrative
- ✅ **Manages ambiguity**: Clearly states "It's free" and sets boundaries
- ✅ **Assumes systems work logically**: Expects Facebook Marketplace to follow rules
- ✅ **Copes through creation**: Uses humour, sarcasm, and storytelling as forms of emotional regulation - a kind of **autistic masking**

🌀 Under stress, Lou seeks **control through structure** - setting exact pickup times, delegating roles ("Ask for Tim"), and translating chaos into art.

## 🤯 The Twist: Eileen - the Emotive, Hyperfocused Neurodivergent
Eileen bursts into the story like a whirlwind of **emotional urgency and literal interpretation**, suggesting traits associated with ADHD, rejection sensitivity, or borderline emotional styles:

- 🕔 **Time blindness**: Arrives at 5 a.m., misinterpreting "See you at 5"
- 🎯 **Hyperfocus**: Fixates on getting the bed, regardless of signals
- 😭 **Emotional dysregulation**: Expresses herself with intense emoji's ("🪓⛏️🔥 🤢🔥," "😡🐬💩")
- 🚪 **Boundary blurring**: Wakes up housemates, returns uninvited, takes a neighbour's bed by mistake

To Eileen, this is all **logically driven by emotional necessity**. The bed represents a **goal, a connection, a victory** - and failure is existential.

## 🪞 The Collision: Different Desires, Different Distress

| Trait                      | **Lou** (Structure-Oriented)        | **Eileen** (Emotion-Oriented)         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Seeks**                 | Order, predictability, logic         | Connection, approval, and closure     |
| **Coping Mechanism**      | Humor, irony, narrative reframing    | Repetition, volume, urgency           |
| **Trigger**               | Plans being ignored                  | Emotional signals being missed        |
| **Processing Style**      | Externalizes chaos as comedy         | Remains trapped in emotional feedback |

📌 What we're seeing isn't villainy or madness - it's **two neurodivergent people misunderstanding each other**, speaking different neurocognitive "languages" in a **neurotypical system with no translation layer**.

## 📊 Trait Radar Chart: Lou vs. Eileen
To visualise this divergence in cognitive profiles:

![Radar Chart: Lou vs. Eileen](/pics/neurodivergent-trait-profiles-Lou-vs-Eileen.png)

This chart shows:
- Lou's **preference for order, clarity, and indirect emotion**
- Eileen's **emotive urgency, impulsivity, and literalness**

They're not broken - just **differently calibrated**.

## 🔄 The Tragic Comedy of Neurodivergence
What makes this so funny - and painfully relatable - is that it could *easily happen in real life*:
- 😇 Neither person is "wrong" - both are **operating in good faith**
- 📉 Facebook Marketplace, like many platforms, **assumes neurotypical behavior**: vague time, soft expectations, polite emotional distance
- 🎭 Instead, we get a chaotic duet of **raw emotion vs. rigid planning**

## 🧩 Final Thought: Not a Crazy Story - A Neurodivergent Parable
Through a neurodiversity-affirming lens, this isn't just a quirky story. It's a **parable for digital miscommunication**:

> "Two people, each navigating the world with a unique operating system, collide in a system that offers no tech support."

Lou turns this into a musical not just to entertain but to **survive the discomfort** of unresolved social chaos. Eileen fights to get the bed not just as furniture but as **validation**.

It's hilarious. It isn't very clear. It's a little tragic.

But above all

**It's deeply human.**
