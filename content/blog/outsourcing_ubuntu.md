> **As AI accelerates, the closure of South Africa’s TENET mirror exposes cracks in Africa’s digital sovereignty.**
> 
> In Silicon Valley and Shenzhen, AI is fed by vast open-source repositories and mirrored infrastructure. In Africa, one of the continent’s few mirrors has just gone dark. The decision raises uncomfortable questions: **can Africa participate as a peer in the global tech ecosystem, or will it remain dependent on servers in the US, Europe, and China?**

Earlier this month, **TENET** - the non-profit created to serve South African universities and research institutions - announced it will decommission its long-standing mirror service ([mirror.ac.za](https://mirror.ac.za/)). For years, it has hosted **Linux distributions, CRAN (for the R programming language), and other open-source repositories**. The reasons given are practical: *ageing hardware, declining local demand, and stronger international connectivity*. On paper, few will notice the change.

> Mirrors have always been about more than speed. They are about **sovereignty**. They embody a digital form of *Ubuntu*: the idea that we build together, and that shared infrastructure keeps knowledge accessible to all.

For the non-technical, a mirror is like a local copy of a library shelf. Instead of travelling overseas every time you need a book, the local shelf lets you borrow it quickly, cheaply, and reliably. Closing mirrors is like removing that shelf and telling everyone to fetch their books from London or Amsterdam. The book is still available, but the sense of shared access, local contribution, convenience, and control disappears.

Across Africa, technologists such as **Ish Sookun** - the only African serving on the openSUSE board and a long-time advocate for Linux mirrors - have emphasised why this infrastructure matters. Open source cannot thrive in a vacuum; it depends on both infrastructure and community support. Without local mirrors, African developers risk being sidelined as passive consumers rather than active contributors to global innovation.

The timing is symbolic. The **Johannesburg City Library** has just reopened after five years of repairs, a reminder of how physical access to knowledge strengthens communities. Imagine suggesting that because Kindle and Google Books exist, Johannesburg no longer needs a library. We would reject that argument immediately. Yet this is precisely the logic being used to dismantle our digital commons.

> Yes, bandwidth is cheaper, cables are faster, and global distribution is more efficient. But **efficiency is not sovereignty**. If Africa is serious about shaping its digital future, it cannot depend entirely on servers in the US, Europe, or China. It needs its own mirrors, repositories, and infrastructure — rooted here, for our communities.

The decommissioning of TENET’s mirror service should not mark the quiet end of an era. It should spark a renewed conversation among universities, government, and industry about why we must invest in our own digital commons and claim a seat in the global ecosystem.

The real question is not whether mirrors are technically necessary. It is whether Africa intends to be at the heart of open-source innovation - or forever remain on its margins.
