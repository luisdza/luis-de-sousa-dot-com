> **Africa’s digital sovereignty just suffered a quiet blow.**
>
> Earlier this month, South Africa’s TENET — the non-profit serving universities and research institutions — announced it will shut down its long-standing mirror service ([mirror.ac.za](https://mirror.ac.za/)). For most, the loss may look invisible. But behind the silence lies a bigger question: **Will Africa shape its own digital future, or depend on infrastructure it does not control?**

For years, TENET hosted local copies of **Linux distributions, CRAN (for the R programming language),** and **other open-source repositories**. The reasons for closure are practical: *ageing hardware, falling demand, and cheaper global bandwidth*. On paper, few will notice the change. In reality, **much more is at stake.**

> Mirrors are more than speed and convenience — they are **trust anchors**. They prove our code is genuine. They keep Africa working when undersea cables snap, turning fragility into strength. And they embody a digital spirit of **Ubuntu**: we build together, and shared infrastructure keeps knowledge open to all.

In March 2024, four major undersea cables — WACS, ACE, SAT-3, and MainOne — snapped, disrupting connectivity across 13 African countries. For days, whole regions were throttled. The lesson is clear: if every byte comes from overseas, a single cut can silence half a continent.

Across Africa, technologists such as **Ish Sookun** — the only African serving on the openSUSE board and a long-time advocate for Linux mirrors — have long argued for this infrastructure.

> **Without local mirrors, Africa risks outsourcing its digital commons.**
Without local mirrors, developers must fetch code from Europe, Asia, or the US. This is more than a technical nuisance. It **entrenches dependency**, **undermines sovereignty**, and **sidelines Africa from the global conversation on open source**.

**This isn’t only Africa’s fight.**

In 2021, ASREN, WACREN, and UbuntuNet Alliance signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Latin America’s LA Referencia and RedCLARA, committing to **"build capacity and infrastructure in our regions rather than rely on centralised infrastructure hosted elsewhere."** [*AfricaConnect3*](https://africaconnect3.net/africa-and-latin-america-agree-to-closer-collaboration-around-open-science/)

It was a clear statement: sovereignty is regional, and resilience comes from hosting at home, not outsourcing abroad. It’s proof that open science infrastructure - including local mirrors - is not just local resistance, but part of a growing global movement for **digital equity**.

The timing is symbolic. The **Johannesburg City Library** has just reopened after five years of repairs, a reminder of how access to knowledge strengthens communities. Imagine suggesting that because Kindle and Google Books exist, Johannesburg no longer needs a library. We would reject that argument immediately. Yet this is precisely the logic being used to dismantle our **digital commons**.

> Yes, bandwidth is cheaper, cables are faster, and global distribution is more efficient. But

> **Efficiency is not sovereignty**.
>
> If Africa is serious about shaping its digital future, it cannot depend entirely on servers in the US, Europe, or China. It needs its own **mirrors, repositories,** and **infrastructure** — rooted here, for our communities.

Some argue that **contribution** – *writing code, starting projects, and growing communities* – matters more than infrastructure. And they are right: without African commits, open source here remains **consumption, not creation**.

CDNs serve content fast and cheap. But if every byte comes from the US, Europe, or China, Africa is reduced to a client — not a creator.

> **Mirrors aren’t a sideshow. They’re the foundation.**

They cut barriers, train local skills, and prove Africa isn’t only downloading - it’s hosting.
> **Contribution is more than code. In the spirit of Ubuntu, it’s also resilience.**
It’s shared provision of the commons.

**Trust is human.**

A mirror is only as strong as the people behind it. Who runs it, and under what rules, matters as much as bandwidth. Confidence comes from transparent stewardship — by universities, NRENs, and communities.

**And mirrors mean reciprocity.**

They show Africa is not just consuming open source but investing in it. That’s how servers become symbols. That’s how technical infrastructure turns into social infrastructure — the trust Africa needs to stand as a peer in the global commons.

The real question is not whether mirrors are technically necessary. It is whether Africa intends to stand at the heart of open-source innovation — or remain at its margins.

**Building mirrors is not nostalgia. It is sovereignty. It is resilience. It is reciprocity.**

The world will not wait. **The question is simple: will Africa?**
