"Like plants, wisdom requires careful nurturing." – Luis de Sousa

Looking back at my younger self, I realise how much I've learned through moments of failure and success. One pivotal moment that stands out is when I faced burnout. I juggled multiple projects and pushed myself to my limit, thinking I could handle everything without slowing down and finding balance. It wasn't until I hit a breaking point that I realised wisdom isn't just about knowing what to do but understanding when to pause and reflect.

During that time, I learned that sometimes, stepping back is necessary for long-term growth. Through the guidance of therapy and the mystery of faith, I could regain my focus and come back stronger with a clearer sense of direction. Therapy helped me delve deep and reflect on the underlying causes of my burnout, giving me the tools and curiosity to thrive. I've learned that asking better questions leads to better answers, and while it doesn't necessarily make life easier, it does make it more interesting. On the other hand, my faith gave me peace and trust in the process, reminding me to let go of control and lean into patience. This experience taught me that wisdom often lies in having the patience to wait for the right moment to act rather than rushing forward like a bull.

# The Growth of Wisdom
Much like a gardener carefully tending to plants, nurturing wisdom means being mindful of the process. I've learned that wisdom grows when we actively seek knowledge, reflect on our decisions, and sharpen our critical thinking. It doesn't happen overnight—it requires sustained attention and a commitment to continuous growth.

Neither plants nor wisdom can thrive without this intentional care. They must be nurtured with purpose and patience, allowing us to grow intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually. Without the right conditions, plants wilt and struggle to survive. Similarly, wisdom can fade if we neglect to seek knowledge or ignore growth opportunities. Like plants, wisdom needs consistent nourishment—through learning, reflection, and adapting to life's challenges.

# My Journey
I was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am a data and analytics consultant at [Syeop](https://www.syeop.co.za). In my role at Syeop, I focus on helping businesses make data-driven decisions, but it's more than just numbers—it's about cultivating understanding. Similarly, through co-leading the [Johannesburg R User Group](https://www.rusergroup.co.za) and [PyData Johannesburg](https://www.pydata.co.za), I've seen how creating spaces for learning fosters not just intellectual growth, but a community rooted in curiosity and collaboration.

Outside work, I find balance through CrossFit, rock climbing, reading, and hiking. Each hobby offers valuable lessons in patience and growth. CrossFit teaches me the importance of persistence and learning new skills step by step, while rock climbing emphasises careful planning and choosing the right path to reach the top. Reading allows me to take time and immerse myself in different perspectives, experiencing a story as it unfolds. On the other hand, hiking reminds me to appreciate the journey, not just the destination, and to be mindful of my environment.

# Conclusion
Cultivating wisdom, like caring for a garden, is not a one-time effort. It's a lifelong practice that requires attention and dedication. Whether in my professional journey or personal growth, I've learned that the small, consistent steps we take today determine how deeply our wisdom roots tomorrow.

As you navigate your journey, take a moment to ask yourself: What are you doing today to nurture your wisdom? Are you feeding your mind with new ideas and experiences? Let's commit to growing together, one thoughtful step at a time.
